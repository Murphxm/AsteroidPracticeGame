# AsteroidPracticeGame
My attempt at recreating an old classic just by replicating mechanics without looking at source code.


I kind of broke it prior to uploading it to git.
The break is due to me attempting to make a state system so I can press more than 1 directional key at a time because at the moment only one keyPress registers at a time.

I will however upload this as my version 1.0 and iterate in later versions.
